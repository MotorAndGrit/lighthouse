Lighthouse is a lightning-fast advanced search engine API for publications on the lbrycrd with autocomplete capabilities.
The official lighthouse instance is live at https://lighthouse.lbry.com

### What does Lighthouse consist of?

1. Elasticsearch as a backend db server.
2. LBRYimport, an importer that imports the claims into the Elasticsearch database.
3. Lighthouse API server, which serves the API and does all calculations about what to send to the end user. 
### API Documentation / Usage example
To make a simple search by string:
```
https://lighthouse.lbry.com/search?s=stringtosearch
```
To get autocomplete suggestions:
```
https://lighthouse.lbry.com/autocomplete?s=stringtocomp
```

## Installation
### Prerequisites
* [Elasticsearch6.6](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)


>To get started you should clone the git:
```
git clone https://github.com/lbryio/lighthouse

>Make sure elasticsearch is running and run (from the lighthouse dir):
```
./dev.sh
